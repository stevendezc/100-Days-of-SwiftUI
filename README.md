# 100 Days of SwiftUI - Hacking with Swift by Paul Hudson

Welcome to my repository where I document and showcase the projects and lessons I've learned throughout the **100 Days of SwiftUI** course by Paul Hudson at [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100). 

This repository contains a collection of projects, exercises, and key learnings from each day of the course. If you're interested in improving your SwiftUI skills, feel free to browse the code, check out the projects, and follow along!

## üìö About the Course

The **100 Days of SwiftUI** course by Paul Hudson is a comprehensive guide designed to help developers of all skill levels get hands-on experience with **SwiftUI** by building real-world projects and understanding the key concepts of iOS app development. Over the course of 100 days, you'll learn everything from basic views to more complex animations, data handling, and more.

## üèóÔ∏è Projects & Lessons

Below you'll find a breakdown of each day's project or lesson, along with links to the corresponding code or explanations where applicable:

### Day 1 - Getting Started with SwiftUI
- Introduction to SwiftUI: Understanding basic layout concepts like `Text`, `VStack`, and `HStack`.
- [Code Example](./day1)

### Day 2 - Working with Stacks
- Diving deeper into stack layouts, building simple UI components using `VStack`, `HStack`, and `ZStack`.
- [Code Example](./day2)

### Day 3 - SwiftUI Modifiers
- Exploring view modifiers in SwiftUI for customizing the appearance of views.

... *(Continue for all 100 days)* ...

### Day 100 - Final Project: Building a Complete SwiftUI App
- A full-fledged SwiftUI app that integrates all the knowledge learned throughout the course, including advanced UI, navigation, and data handling.
- [Final Project Code](./final-project)

## üöÄ What You'll Learn

Throughout the **100 Days of SwiftUI**, you'll learn:

- Building user interfaces with SwiftUI, including forms, lists, navigation, and more.
- State management using `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@Environment`.
- Data-driven UIs using `List`, `ForEach`, and `LazyVStack`.
- Handling gestures and animations for rich user interactions.
- Integrating UIKit components in a SwiftUI app.
- Working with Combine framework for reactive programming.
- Advanced topics like CoreData integration, networking, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: The primary framework used to build UIs.
- **Combine**: For reactive data handling.
- **CoreData**: For local data storage (used in later lessons).
- **UIKit**: Interoperating with UIKit components when necessary.
- **Xcode**: The development environment used for all projects.
